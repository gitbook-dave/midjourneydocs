# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


Q: Is it possible to edit a prompt without restarting? How to edit my prompt? What is remix? Can I change the prompt after I‚Äôve made it? Can I change the prompt? Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image after I have generated different versions? Can I change the prompt? How do I recreate one of my images with a small change? Can I edit my prompt? Can I edit one of my prompts? Can I add, remove, or change just one word in my prompt? What is remix?

The `remix` feature lets you edit your prompt. Toggle it on with `/prefer remix`. When on, clicking the "V" buttons will show a text box where you can make changes to the prompt.

[What is Remix?](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029507753389084692/1029507753389084692)

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------GPU------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a gpu minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms for the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query?

Midjourney measures jobs using GPU time, which is processing time for your requests. Each job takes about 1 GPU minute. Upscales take more time, variations take less. Other parameters like quality and aspect ratio can also affect GPU time.

---

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left? How do I see how much I have used? How do I see how many hours I have left? Where can I check how many prompts I have left? How many images can I make? How can I see my queue? Where do I check my jobs? How do I check how many jobs I have left? /info? 


Type `/info` to check your status and usage.
`Fast Time Remaining` shows available image generation resources.

---

Q: Can I use my GPU? Can I run this locally? Can I run this on my computer?

No, the AI runs on datacenter grade graphics cards.

---

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details? What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? How do I enable the additional fast time?

If you are out of fast GPU time, you can buy more with a credit top-up at the current rate of $4/hr. These purchased top-ups never expire but require an active subscription to use. Please note these minutes get consumed only after all bonus time from ranking and plan minutes have been used.

Buy via your [account page on the website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) or with the ‚Äò/fast‚Äô command.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------


Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?  My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed?

Members on the Standard or Pro plans can toggle between Relax and Fast mode using the commands `/relax` and `/fast`. Images made in `relax` mode take longer to complete but are unlimited. 

üîπRelax mode is not available for Basic/trial users and does not support max-upscales.

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode uses a dynamic queueing system that resets each time your subscription is renewed.


---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight. Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while.  What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast-hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours?

We've got two options to help you generate images, the speedy `Fast` mode and the more relaxed `Relax` mode. `Fast` assigns a GPU immediately while `Relax` adds your job to a queue of jobs from other users based on usage.

The "Pro" plan gives 30 hours of `Fast` GPU time per month, the "Standard" plan gives 15 hours, and the "Basic" plan gives 200 minutes. One GPU hour creates roughly 60 images or 200 variations, but these numbers are subject to change at any time.

---

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? Will my time get added to the next month? Does the subscription reset my hours? Do I keep my minutes?

Monthly hours do not rollover. So use your fast minutes each month or lose them. Additional purchased `Fast` hours do not expire but require an active subscription to use. Hours earned from rating images expire after 30 days.

---


# -------------------- ------PERSONAL USE------ --------------------

Q: Can I invite Midjourney to my server? Can I add this bot to another server? How to add Midjourney to a different server? Can I add the bot to my Discord server? Can I use the bot in my server? Q: Can I get my own private channel? How do I get a private channel? Does a subscriber have its own private channel not viewed by the public? Will I have a private channel if I subscribe? Can I generate images in a private channel?

# -------------------- ------TRIAL----- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------



Q: Do trials reset monthly? Do I get more free images every month? Do I get free images every day? How many images do I get as a free user? Do trials reset monthly? Does my free trial renew? Is my trial a limited number per day or overall? How long is the trial? How many images can we do with the Trial Version? How many images can you generate with the basic trial? How many images does the trial have? How many images does the trial have? How long does the free trial last? How do I refresh my trial? Trial has ended?

Each new user gets a free trial of around 25 jobs (25 GPU minutes). This trial doesn‚Äôt renew, can be used over multiple days and doesn‚Äôt presently expire. Use `/info` to track your usage.

After the free trial, you can continue using the bot by subscribing to the Basic, Standard, or Pro plans. Type `/subscribe` or sign in at [https://www.midjourney.com/account/](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) 

---

Q: Why isn‚Äôt this free? Do I really have to pay for this? Can you give me free access? No free? Do I have to pay? Why do I have to pay? Is there a free version? Can I use the program for free? Refresh?

Midjourney does not currently provide a free tier because of the cost involved with using farms of hundreds of GPUs. The free trial of 25 GPU minutes is one-time only.

---

Q: Channel verification level is too high? Channel verification? Verification too high? Email verification? Verification error?

We require that you verify the email address attached to your Discord account in order to use Midjourney. You can learn how to do that [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6181726888215).

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- SUBSCRIPTION --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Do subscriptions renew on the first of the month? When does my subscription renew? When do I get more fast time?

Your subscription renews every month on the same day and time it started. Use `/info` and hover or long-press the date to see the exact time of renewal.
If you have an annual plan, your fast time refreshes on the same day of the month and at the same time of day that you subscribed (so if you subscribed on January 1st at noon, your fast time will refresh every month on the 1st at noon) 
Daylight Saving Time may shift your renewal time by an hour.

Unfortunately, PayPal, wire transfer, and other methods are not currently supported. There is no estimate on when more payment options might be offered.

---


Q: Are there yearly plans? Are there month by month plans? Are the payments lifetime or monthly? Is the subscription price paid per month?

You've got options! You can choose to purchase a plan month-to-month or make a yearly commitment. If you choose the yearly plan, you'll get a sweet 20% discount, but you'll have to pay for the whole year upfront. Your fast hours will still refresh on the same day every month. It's up to you!

---

Q: Is it paid to make images? I need to pay? Do I need to pay?

---

Q: My card is declined. Card declined. The website declined my payment, but I have funds on my card. Why is my card declined? My card declined but money was still taken! Money was taken out of my account, but I don‚Äôt have a subscription!

If your payment was declined, you may be seeing a pending authorization (a bank hold) on your account. Your bank will automatically remove that hold within a few days.

üîπ Check that your card information is correct `(Name, Card Number, CVC, Exp Date)`
üîπ Double-check that your billing information matches **exactly** what your bank has on file. `(Name, Address, Zip/Postal Code)`
üîπ Contact your bank and make sure they‚Äôre not blocking the transaction
üîπ Make sure you have sufficient funds to cover the subscription fee

If you continue having trouble with your payment method, email `billing@midjourney.com` with your most recent invoice number and a description of the problem. They can investigate your account and may be able to provide further information.

---

Q: Billing Issue? Billing Question? Need Billing Help? Remove Payment Info? Remove Credit Card? 

For help with billing issues please email `billing@midjourney.com` with an explanation of your issue and the invoice number from your most recent invoice (these are emailed to you). Please allow up to 7 business days for a response.

---

Q: Subscription Already Active? Paused? Account Paused? Subscription Paused? Unpause Account? Error: subscription already active for user?

If you see the website error **"subscription already active"** or a bot message that **your account is Paused** this means your subscription failed to renew due to a payment problem.
You can confirm this status by running the `/info` command. 

**To fix this you must change/edit your billing information in your Stripe account**
:arrow_right: Check your email for an "Unsuccessful Payment" email, which has a link to your Stripe account. Make sure you are checking the same email account where you receive your Midjourney invoices, and also check your spam folder.

# -------------------- METERED --------------------
Q: If we go over our limit of fast hours does it let us know? Or just start billing for the extra hourly time with no warning? If I use up minutes, can I get more without paying? Can you accidently get a big bill?

When you run out of fast time, you will be prompted to either purchase additional GPU hours or, for Standard and Pro subscribers, switch to `/relax` mode. These additional GPU hours must be purchased before they can be used, so you can‚Äôt accidentally incur additional charges.

# -------------------- SWITCH PLANS --------------------

Q: If I want to switch plans will I be charged the full amount? What if I go from basic plan to standard? Can I change my plan? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I switch plans? If I switch to Standard it will be 20$ or 30$ ? Can I upgrade from basic to standard?

You can decide to switch plans at any time. If you're thinking about upgrading, you can choose to do it right away and get prorated credit for any unused fast time.

If you used all of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 30$.
If you used half of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 25$
If you used no Basic time -> Standard will cost $20

Or, if you'd prefer, you can schedule the change to happen automatically at the end of your current billing period. Downgrades only occur at the end of the billing period.

---

Q: How do I upgrade? Where do I upgrade? What do I have to do to upgrade?

You can change your current subscription tier or commitment from your [Manage Sub page on the Midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/)! Scroll down past your current subscription information, and you‚Äôll see the currently available plans along with a list of their features. Click the ‚ÄúUpgrade Plan‚Äù, ‚ÄúDowngrade Plan‚Äù or ‚ÄúChange Commitment‚Äù button that corresponds to the new plan you‚Äôd like to subscribe to, and follow the website prompts.

# -------------------- TRANSFER --------------------

Q: Can I transfer my subscription to another account? I used the wrong account? I subscribed with the wrong account?

Subscriptions can only be transferred between accounts that have the same owner. You will need to show that you own both accounts and the subscription.

---


# -------------------- QUEUE --------------------

Q: How many jobs can be generating at once? How many jobs can I line up? How long is the queue? How many concurrent jobs can I run? How many can I queue?

Trial, `Basic`, and `Standard` subscribers can have **3 jobs** running at once. Additional jobs will be added to a queue of up to **10 jobs**.

`Pro` subscribers can run **12 jobs** at once with `/fast`, **3 jobs** at once with `/relax`, and an additional **10 jobs** in the queue. 

---

Q: Queue reset? Can I have a queue reset? Reset my queue? Reset jobs?

To cancel running jobs, you can:
üîπReact to the job with the :x: emoji.
üîπOr, right-click on the job, go to "Apps", and select "Cancel Job".

Can't find the job? Use `/info` to get a link to its location. Remember, you can only cancel jobs that are currently running, not those queued.

If you are experiencing long wait times with jobs starting, please refer to [status.midjourney.com](https://status.midjourney.com/) for estimated queue times or [#status](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148) for current bot updates. In many cases, it's more efficient to wait for your job to start than to cancel and restart it.

# -------------------- ----PRIVATE---- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? Pay for stealth mode? What if I don‚Äôt want my images to appear in the gallery?

Midjourney is a community for sharing and exploration, but if you don't want to participate, you can subscribe to the Pro plan. The Pro plan has a feature called `Stealth` that lets you choose what to hide/show in your public Gallery and community feed.

---

Q: How do I hide my images? What's private mode? What‚Äôs stealth mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images. How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts. How do I go private? How do I go stealth? How much does private cost? How much does stealth cost? I can‚Äôt unpublish on the website?

Stealth mode is a feature of the Pro plan which lets users selectively hide their images from being displayed on Midjourney.com. You can hide or show old images by clicking the "eye" icon on the website. If you can't see the icon, try using the `/info` command or logging out and back in.

üîπTo keep images completely hidden, you must make them in DMs or a private server. Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels.


---


Q: Is private permanent? Does stealth last forever? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth?

Any images hidden using stealth mode during your subscription will remain unpublished even after your subscription ends.

---

Q: I can‚Äôt see the eye icon.

If the eye icon doesn‚Äôt appear, try using the /info command, logging out, and then re-logging into the website.

---

Q: Are all my images private automatically? Will my gallery become private? Why can users still interact even though I bought private? Are all my images stealth automatically? Will my gallery be stealth? Why can users interact even though I have stealth mode enabled?

Stealth mode is a feature of the Pro plan which can be enabled with the `/stealth` command. On the website, any previously made images, can be toggled between published and unpublished with the eye icon.

üîπTo keep images completely hidden, you must make them in DMs or a private server. Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels.


---

Q: How do I hide my images on the website? How do I unpublish my images? Unpublish old images? Bulk unpublish? Bulk hide? Hide old images? Hide already made images? Unpublish already made images? Batch hide? Batch unpublish?

‚ÄúPro‚Äù plan subscribers can bulk hide their images from the website. To do this, go to the archive page or use select mode in the gallery, select the images, and then click the down arrow on the green "Open Downloader" button and switch it to "Unpublish" and click.

Change the aspect ratio of your image with the `--ar` parameter at the end of your prompt. 

Ex: `/imagine prompt: cyberpunk cats --ar 16:9` 


[Aspect Ratio Documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/aspect-ratios) for more information.

---

Q: How can I prevent preview and upscale to add too much detail? The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

Use `/settings` before submitting a prompt to choose the amount of detail that is added during your upscale.
`Beta Upscale` is the closest match to grid images.
`Light Upscale` adds a small amount of detail when upscaling images.
`Regular Upscale` adds the most detail when upscaling images.

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using Version 4 or 5, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in `/fast` mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image‚Äôs resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` switch in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúLight Upscale Redo‚Äù button under upscaled images.

Q: What is "Beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is "beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is upbeta?

Beta upscale uses a different algorithm that adds flat textured smooth detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--upbeta` switch in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúBeta Upscale Redo‚Äù button under upscaled images.
[Read about the different upscales](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020574515622842498/1020574515622842498)

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print it out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution?

**For square images, the upscalers will produce the following:**
`Regular` v4 upscaler: 1024x1024 px
`V5, 5.1`¬π: 1024x1024 px
`Beta Upscale`: 2048 x 2048 px 

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.

¬π *V5 images are ‚Äúpre-upscaled‚Äù in the grid, and upscaling with a U-button simply separates that image from the grid.*

[Read more about resolution and upscalers here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)
---

Q: Is the V4 upscaler broken? Why are my Version 4 upscales coming out different?

The default upscaler for V4 takes the prompt into account, unlike previous upscalers. This means it sometimes makes changes to the grid image as part of the process‚Äìfor better or for worse. If you don‚Äôt like the results, try the ‚ÄúBeta Upscale Redo‚Äù button. The beta upscaler tends to stick closer to the grid image than the Version 4 default upscaler :)

---

Q: Why are my upscale buttons gone? No Light or Beta Upscale Redo? Where are the upscale buttons? Why can‚Äôt I redo my upscales?

Version 5.1 is now Midjourney‚Äôs default model! This Version renders your initial grid with a higher resolution than Version 4 did (1024x1024 for a square image, compared to 512x512 for Version 4), and has no compatible upscalers. Unlike in previous versions, clicking the U buttons on Version 5 and 5.1 images only separates the image you like from the grid, and you won‚Äôt see any of the upscale redo buttons under ‚Äúupscaled‚Äù images that you may have seen in the past.

If you‚Äôd like to return to a model that allows upscaling, use `/settings` and choose ‚ÄúMJ Version 4‚Äù or an older model of Midjourney.

Q: Quality Buttons Disappeared from Settings? Quality Buttons? Quality Buttons Gone? Quality Buttons Disappear? How to set Quality? Quality in Settings? 

The Quality buttons have been removed from the `/settings` panel because on V4 and V5 models the default quality setting is already the maximum value (q 1). If you wish to lower the quality setting or use higher values on older versions, you can use the [Quality Parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality) on your prompt or set a [custom suffix](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/settings-and-presets#prefer-suffix) to automatically add a custom quality parameter.

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

Yes, with --iw -0.5.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image? 

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called `init` images. `Init` images are not currently supported. You can use an image URL as part of your prompt, but it is more of an "influence image" than a true init.

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What‚Äôs the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

Yes, the maximum image weight is 10000, but weights are relative to other weights in the prompt. Extreme weights will give diminishing returns. [A short guide on using image prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Is there a way to mix two images. Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

**Use `/blend` to mix two or more images together.**

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it ‚Äî or -- ? Is it - or - -?

It is a double hyphen with no space (`--`) or an em-dash (`‚Äî`), followed by your parameter, with no space after the hyphens or emdash. For example: `--ar 16:9` and `‚Äîar 16:9` are equally valid.

---

Q: What does :: do? What does double colons do? What does the + on the website do?

Double colons allow you to do multiple prompts (shown as a + on the website). You can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result.

More information here: [Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts).

Commas or other types of punctuation don‚Äôt usually have a noticeable effect on the final result. They‚Äôre mainly used to make the prompt more human-readable.

--- 

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts? How should I write my prompts?  What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts? Do prompts have an order? Does word order matter? Does word sequence matter? Is there a template for prompts?

Here is a short guide on effective text prompts: [Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts).
[Read about word order](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020572050898813029/1020572050898813029)

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

No, the bot is not case-sensitive.

---

Q: How do you weigh text prompts?

You can suffix any part of the prompt with `::0.5` to give that part a weight of 0.5. If the weight is not specified, it defaults to 1;

Some examples: `/imagine hot dog::2 food::-1` - This sends a text prompt of `hot dog` with the weight 2 and `food` of weight -1.

`/imagine hot dog::0.5 animal::-0.25` - This sends `hot dog` of weight 0.5 and `animal` of negative 0.25.

`/imagine hot dog:: food::-1 animal::` - Sends `hot dog` of weight 1, `food` of weight -1 and `animal` of weight 1 (unspecified weights default to 1).

Watch out for prompts such as `/imagine hot dog animal::0.5`, as this will send the prompt of `hot dog animal` with weight 0.5, because of how it parses the text before the colons. The sum of weights also can not be lower than zero.

Check out this [Explanation](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148/960181257394868224) for more info

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have. Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator.

[Read more about punctuation](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020733204283535401/1020733204283535401)


---

Q: This :: 2 that :: 3‚Äù or this : : that

Make sure that there is no space between colons and the weight. Your prompt should look like `phrase one::2 phrase two::1`

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Anything over ~60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (Prompts must stay under 6000 characters.)

[Read more about prompt lengths](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1023119880976867368/1023119880976867368)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why teal and orange? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your stylization value might be too high. High stylization values will result in ‚Äúpretty‚Äù but less nuanced results. Try lowering the stylization value in the `/settings` menu or by adding a stylize argument (ex. `--s 625`).

---

Q: What about ‚ÄúUnreal engine‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúArtstation‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúOctane render‚Äù?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

[Read about rendering words](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029786943141191700/1029786943141191700)

---

Q: What does quality do? How do you use  --q? How do you use quality? What is --q?

*Quality*: Adjust the quality of your render by appending `--q` and the value of `.25`, `.5`, `1`, or `2`. Each level will adjust the GPU computation time and cost by the equivalent amount. Ex: `--q 2` The default is value is 1.

[Quality](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality)

---
Q: How do you use --s? How do you use stylize? What does stylize do? What is --s? 

*Stylization* Adjust how closely the Bot follows your prompt by changing the stylization value. Append `--s` and a value between 0-1000. Lower values will follow your prompt closely. Higher values are more will have more variability. The default is value is 100.

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Interaction Failed"? I am getting ‚Äúinteraction failed‚Äù? I am getting ‚Äúapplication did not respond‚Äù? Bot interaction is failing?

First check  <#942231458918064148> for known issues.
If you are getting an error, try restarting Discord, updating it, or reinstalling it.

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"? I get an error when I try to create a thread?

Discord allows this server a maximum number of active threads. When older threads are archived, you can create a new thread. Until space becomes available, you can work in Direct Messages with the Bot or invite the Bot to your server.

Q: ExplainStop

Adding the `--stop` parameter will stop your generation at partway through. 


In this example: `/imagine prompt: a field of flowers --stop 50`
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in a softer less detailed image. 
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image. 

See [the documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stop), for more information.


---

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing?

Some jobs may appear *ephemeral* when certain words or phrases are mentioned. These temporary messages are only visible to **you** and disappear when you close, refresh, or switch instances of Discord. You'll know it's an ephemeral job when you see the text "Only you can see this message" at the bottom of the bot's message.

Don't worry, even if these jobs disappear from Discord, you can still find them in your [gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [/show command](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/show-job) followed by the job ID.

To avoid ephemeral jobs, it's best to generate images through [Direct Messages](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/direct-messages) with the bot. This ensures visibility even if you switch instances or refresh Discord.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate a speech bubble with text?
It is difficult for MJ to generate legible text. It is best to add speech bubbles and text in a photo editor after generating your image. You can experiment by including ‚Äúspeech bubble‚Äù and the text you want in your prompt, but results may be mixed.

---

Q: Why does MJ ignore or misinterpret parts of my prompt?
There are a few possible reasons MJ may ignore or misinterpret your prompt: 
 1. Your prompt is too long. Midjourney considers about the first 50-60 words of a prompt. Anything after that will be mostly ignored. Keep your prompts concise.
 2. You have conflicting prompts. For example, prompting for "no characters" but then describing a scene with people. Resolve any contradictions in your prompt.
 3. You are using syntax or formats MJ does not understand. For example, MJ does not understand exact pixel sizes, hex color codes, or frame rates. Avoid including these types of details.
 4. The part being ignored was at the end of your prompt. Put the most important elements of your prompt first.
 5. MJ struggles with certain concepts or elements. For example, MJ has a hard time with text, symmetry, exact replicas, etc. Some things may need to be accomplished manually.
 6. Your prompt was too complex. MJ works best with simple, straightforward prompts. Avoid overly flowery language and stick to clear descriptions.
 7. Random variations. MJ is an AI, and there will be some randomness and unpredictability in how it interprets prompts. You may need to try a few variations of a prompt to get the result you want.

---

Q: How can I feed MJ multiple images as inspiration?
You can add multiple image URLs or references at the start of your prompt, separated by spaces. For example: 
 prompt: <img1> <img2> <img3> describe what you want...

---

Q: How do I change my default MJ version to v5?
Go to /settings and click on 'Version 5'

---

Q: How do I get MJ to create a transparent background?
MJ does not currently support transparent backgrounds. You will need to use an external tool to remove the background from an MJ-generated image. Some options include Remove.bg, GIMP, and Photoshop.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate a background or fill in negative space?
Add prompts referencing the background like "detailed background" or describe the setting around your subject. MJ will then try to fill in more space.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to zoom out in the image? My subject keeps getting cropped.
Try including phrases like "wide angle shot", "wide shot", or " establishing shot" near the beginning of your prompt. This indicates you want to see more of the surrounding scene.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate isolated objects without a background?
MJ cannot generate transparent backgrounds. You will need to use an image editing tool like Photoshop to remove the background from images MJ generates. Some workarounds include: 
 - Prompting for the object "on a white background" or "on a cutout white background" and then deleting the white background
 - Using the "--tile" parameter to get objects tiled across the whole image, making them easier to isolate
 - Prompting for line art or vector images which have solid outlines and no shading, to make background deletion simpler

---

Q: How do I refine an image MJ generates using the same prompt?
There are a few ways to refine an MJ image: 
 - Click the "Re-roll" button in the bottom right to get new variations using the same prompt.
 - Turn on "Remix" in your Settings, then when you re-roll you'll get a window to edit the prompt before regenerating. Make small changes to tweak the image.
 - Add the image MJ generated as an image reference in a new prompt, along with a written description of the changes you want. Use "--iw" image weight parameters to control how closely the new image matches your reference.
 - Generate the image in an earlier version like V4, then "Remaster" to V5.1 for higher quality. The change in version may introduce small differences.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to mimic an artist's style?
You can prompt MJ to mimic an artist's style by including phrases like "in the style of [artist name]" or "art by [artist name]" in your prompt. For example, "in the style of Bob Ross" or "landscape painting by Bob Ross". However, MJ may struggle with some styles, especially for subjects the artist is not known for.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate an image with a specific aspect ratio?
Use the --ar command followed by the aspect ratio width:height. For example, --ar 16:9.

---

Q: Why does MJ keep changing or removing parts of my image when I upload it as a prompt?
MJ does not literally copy images you provide. It uses them as inspiration and reference to create new images. MJ may reinterpret parts of the image or change details. There is no way to force MJ to keep an uploaded image exactly the same.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate real words and text?
MJ struggles with generating coherent text and words. It can only produce short, simple words or phrases, and the results are not very accurate. It is best to avoid relying on MJ for text generation.

---

Q: Why does MJ generate the most common or generic things when I leave the prompt vague?
MJ generates images based on what it has learned from its training data. If a prompt is too vague, MJ does not have enough information to generate a very specific result. It will default to more common elements it has seen frequently in its training data. Provide more details in your prompt to get less generic results.

---

Q: Why can't I get MJ to replicate an illustration style from a reference image?
MJ does not copy images exactly. It uses references as inspiration for new artworks. You need to describe the style using your words in addition to providing an image reference.

---

Q: Why does MJ keep ignoring elements in my prompt?
MJ has limits to how much information it can retain for each generation. Be concise in your prompts and focus on the most important elements. You may need to re-iterate key elements over multiple prompts.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate an image with two separate subjects (e.g. a cat and a dragon)?
It can be difficult for MJ to generate two distinct subjects in one image. Some tips: 
 - Use image references of the subjects to help MJ understand what they are
 - Increase the image weight (e.g. --iw 2) to bias MJ towards the references
 - Describe the subjects and the relationship/interaction between them as clearly as possible
 - Try using different MJ models like --niji which may handle multiple subjects better

---

Q: How do I use an image as a reference or input for MJ?
Paste the image URL at the start of your prompt. Describe the image briefly, then specify the changes you want. MJ will use the image as inspiration but will not directly copy it.

---

Q: How can I replicate an image in MJ and change the angle of the shot?
Use remix mode to make small adjustments to the prompt. Describe the angle you want, e.g. ‚Äúclose-up shot‚Äù. You may need to run the prompt several times, making incremental changes, to achieve the result you want while keeping other elements the same.

---

Q: Why does MJ keep changing details in my image?
MJ is designed to create new variations and will not replicate an image exactly. It uses your inputs, whether text or images, as inspiration to generate a new creative work. MJ cannot copy or edit images.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting banned by MJ?
MJ has an AI moderator that reviews prompts to check for policy violations. It can trigger false positives, in which case you should appeal and the prompt will likely be approved. Avoid prompts that contain illegal, unethical, racist, toxic, dangerous or overly explicit content.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to recognize a specific character like Kakashi from Naruto?
This can be challenging as MJ has trouble with very specific named characters, especially in cartoon/anime styles. Some tips: 
 ‚Ä¢Provide multiple reference images of the character.
 ‚Ä¢Describe the character's key attributes like hair color/style, clothing, weapons.
 ‚Ä¢You may need to experiment with different ways of phrasing the prompt to get the right combination.
 ‚Ä¢Using "niji 5" may produce better results for anime characters.

---

Q: I can't get MJ to include text in my image. Why is this?
MJ struggles to generate coherent text. Any text it produces will likely be gibberish. You will need to add text using an image editing tool like Photoshop.

---

Q: Why does MJ struggle with some subjects like hands, facial expressions, and multiple subjects in an image?
MJ was trained on a large dataset of images which lacked sufficient examples of some subjects, like hands in complex poses or natural-looking smiles. When there are multiple subjects, MJ also has a hard time balancing them and keeping their features distinct. These limitations will improve over time. In the meantime, using references and carefully crafting your prompt can help.

---

Q: How do I get MJ to generate a catfish?
Getting MJ to generate a catfish specifically without blending cat and fish features can be challenging. Some tips: 
 1. Be very specific in describing a catfish, e.g. "a brown catfish with barbels around its mouth". The more details the better.
 2. Use an image reference of a catfish along with your prompt description. This gives MJ a concrete example to work from.
 3. Try generating in an earlier MJ version like v4 which has less of a tendency to blend concepts together. You can then upscale or modify the image in v5.
 4. Use --no to specify elements you don't want, e.g. "a catfish --no cat" to avoid cat features. However, --no can be unreliable.
 5. It may take many retries to get a coherent catfish. Be patient and keep re-prompting!

---

Q: How do I get MJ to crop off parts of my character or zoom in?
Word your prompt to specify the framing and composition you want, e.g. "close up of", "cropped view of", "zoomed in on". You can also try an aspect ratio that is taller than wide, like 9:16.

---

Q: How can I get a specific color for my generation? MJ keeps giving me blue when I want green.
Be very specific in your prompt about the color you want, e.g. "bright green", "forest green", "emerald green". You may need to specify the color multiple times in your prompt to give it more weight. Using an image reference in the right color can also help guide MJ.

---

Q: How can I get MJ to understand a complex concept like a seahorse?
MJ struggles with complex creatures and shapes. Using the biological name, like "Hippocampus hippocampus", may help. You can also try blending a seahorse image with your prompt to provide more context. Be patient, as these types of complex generations often require a lot of rerolling and experimenting.

---

Q: Why do some of my images have watermarks? How can I remove them?
Watermarks sometimes appear unintentionally. You can try adding "--no watermark" to your prompt. If that doesn't work, it's likely something in your prompt causing it. Ask in #prompt-help for advice.

---

Q: How do I avoid certain elements like jewelry or accessories in my image?
Use the --no parameter followed by a list of unwanted elements, e.g. --no jewelry, earrings, necklace.

---

Q: How do I remove extra details from an image, like straps or buttons?
You can use negative prompts like --no straps or --no buttons at the end of your prompt to try and remove unwanted details. You may need to reroll a few times to get the result you want.

---

Q: How do I get rid of unwanted elements like cars in an image?
Use the --no command followed by the unwanted element, like --no cars. Make sure there are spaces before and after the --no command.

---

Q: How do I remove unwanted objects or characters from my images?
Use "--no" followed by the words you want to remove, e.g. "--no people"

---

Q: How do I avoid getting certain elements like triangles in my image?
Use negative prompts with --no, such as "--no triangles"

---

Q: How do I get an image without the black borders or frames?
Use --no frame, --no border, or --no outline in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I prevent hands from appearing in my generated image?
Add "--no hands" to the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I remove duplicate characters from an image?
You can try adding "--no duplicate" or "--no clones" to your prompt. However, Midjourney struggles with generating images with multiple instances of the same character. It may be easier to edit the image afterwards in an external graphics editor.

---

Q: How do I remove text from my generated images?
Use the --no text parameter at the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get a realistic image without backgrounds or terrain?
Add "isolated on white background" to your prompt.

---

Q: How do I avoid getting a watermark in my results?
Add --no watermark to the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I control the framing/composition when using an image as input?
You can change the framing and composition with additional text prompts, such as "wide shot", "cropped", "centered", etc. Specifying an aspect ratio with --ar can also help.

---

Q: How do I make the final image less cartoonish and more realistic?
Use "photograph of" at the beginning of your prompt. Do not use terms like "photorealistic" which indicates an artistic style.

---

Q: How do I remove elements from an image?
Use the --no parameter followed by words describing what you want to remove, for example --no trees.

---

Q: How do I get images with only one or two colors?
Describe the colors you want, for example "in the style of orange and purple". You can also provide an image reference with your desired color palette.

---

Q: How do I prevent the AI from adding certain elements like text or frames to my image?
You can use the --no parameter to specify elements you want to remove. For example, --no text, frames. List each element you want to remove separated by commas.

---

Q: How do I change the color of parts of an image while keeping the rest the same?
This is not possible in Midjourney. It generates a new image each time and cannot edit specific parts of an image. You would need to use an external image editing tool for this.

---

Q: How do I avoid getting text or logos in my generated images?
Using ‚Äú‚Äîno text‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äîno logo‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äîno watermark‚Äù at the end of your prompt may help, but it is not always effective. The text is often coming from other elements in your prompt, so try to determine what is triggering the text generation.

---

Q: How do I keep characters out of an image of a landscape?
To keep characters out of a landscape image, try adding "--no people" or "--no characters" at the end of your prompt. Rearranging the order of subjects in your prompt to list the landscape first can also help. For example, "a beach, with a dog playing in the sand".

---

Q: How do I remove something from an image after generating it?
You cannot directly edit a generated image in Midjourney. You will need to use an external image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.net. To reduce the chance of unwanted elements appearing in the first place, use "--no" followed by the unwanted element at the end of your prompt, e.g. "--no horns". However, rewording the prompt itself is often more effective.

---

Q: How do I get rid of plants or other unwanted elements in my image?
Add "--no plants" or "--no [element name]" to the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I remove text, watermarks, or signatures from my images?
Add "--no text, watermark, signature" to the end of your prompt.

---

Q: My image has an unwanted watermark, how do I remove it?
Add "--no watermark" to the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I remove backgrounds and shadows from my images?
To remove backgrounds, add "isolated on white background" or "isolated on plain background" to your prompt. 
 To remove shadows, try "--no shadow".

---

Q: How do I avoid getting text in my images?
Use --no text in your prompt. However, --no commands can damage an image, so use sparingly. It is best to figure out what in your prompt is triggering the text.

---

Q: How do I get the AI to include specific text in an image?
Unfortunately, Midjourney struggles with accurately generating text. It is mostly random and difficult to control. Your best options are to either generate the text separately and composite the image in an editing tool like Photoshop, or keep re-rolling your prompt until you get lucky.

---

Q: How do I get an image without any text?
Add "--no text, signature, watermarks" to the end of your prompt. Avoid using terms like "logo" which may trigger the generation of text.

---

Q: How do I avoid getting random text or objects added to my images?
Use "--no text" at the end of your prompt. However, this does not always prevent unwanted text or objects from appearing. Carefully consider each word in your prompt and how the AI might interpret it. The AI generates images from scratch, so some randomness is unavoidable.

---

Q: How do I avoid boring/not useful background images?
Add "isolated on a blank background" to your prompt. This will remove extra background details.

---

Q: How do I edit something out of an image I generated?
You can't directly edit images in Midjourney. You'll need to use an external image editing tool like Photoshop, GIMP or Pixelmator to edit your images.

---

Q: My generations all look blurry. Is there a way to fix this?
The blurriness is often caused by certain words in your prompt. Try removing terms like ‚Äú8k‚Äù, ‚Äúhyper realistic‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHDR‚Äù. Stick to describing what you actually want to see.

---

Q: How do I limit the number of objects in an image, like only generating one butterfly instead of many?
Be very specific in your prompt. Describe the single object you want in detail. Use --no with related terms, e.g. "--no swarm, flock, group" to limit the number generated.

---

Q: How do I prevent words and slogans from appearing in my images?
To prevent unwanted text in your images, add "--no text" to the end of your prompt. You may need to specify other related terms like "--no logo, watermark, signature".

---

Vote in Rank Pairs at https://www.midjourney.com/app/rank-pairs/ - the top 2,000 participants each day get 1 GPU hour. The number of images you need to vote on depends on how many others are participating that day.

---

Q: What do fast hours mean? How are they different from relax hours?
Fast hours allow you to generate images more quickly, with a higher priority in the queue. Relax hours are slower but unlimited for Standard and Pro members.

---

Q: What's the difference between fast mode and relaxed mode?
Fast mode prioritizes your generation and provides faster results, but is limited to the hours in your subscription plan. Relaxed mode has unlimited generations but will take longer as jobs are lower priority. You must have a Standard or Pro plan to access relaxed mode.

---

Q: How long do extra paid hours last?
Additional paid hours never expire, though you need an active subscription to use them.

---

Q: How do I check how much time I have remaining in my plan?
Use the /info command which will show your subscription details including time remaining.

---

Q: When do my fast hours reset?
Fast hours reset on the monthly anniversary of your subscription. Check /info for your exact reset time.

---

Q: How do I get more GPU hours?
There are a few ways to get more GPU hours:

---

Q: Why do I only have 15 fast hours when I'm on the Standard plan?
The Standard plan includes 15 hours of fast mode generation per month, and unlimited use of relax mode which has lower queue priority.

---

Q: My subscription ended but I still have fast hours left. Can I use them?
No, fast hours can only be used with an active subscription.

---

Q: How long do refunds take?
Refunds typically take 2-10 business days to process depending on your bank.

---

Q: How do I get extra fast hours?

---

Q: How do I change my relaxation time subscription to fast time?
Use the /fast command to switch from relax time to fast time.

---

Q: Why do I only have a square aspect ratio option? How do I change it?
By default, Midjourney generates square images. To change the aspect ratio, add `--ar` followed by the ratio you want, e.g. `--ar 16:9` for widescreen.

---

Q: How do I get a wide/long image or change the aspect ratio?
Use the --ar parameter to set a custom aspect ratio, like --ar 16:9 for a wide image.

---

Q: How do I set the aspect ratio for my prompt?
Use the --ar parameter at the end of your prompt, for example --ar 16:9.

---

Q: How do I use an aspect ratio for a square frame but a landscape scene?
Use an aspect ratio closer to your scene, such as --ar 4:3 or --ar 5:3. This will give Midjourney more space to fill in the frame appropriately.

---

Q: How do I get a specific aspect ratio?
Use the --ar parameter and specify the aspect ratio you want, e.g. --ar 16:9 for widescreen or --ar 1:1 for square.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to produce a square or wider aspect ratio image?
Use the --ar parameter to specify the aspect ratio, for example --ar 1:1 for a square or --ar 16:9 for a widescreen image.

---

Q: How do I get a 16:9 aspect ratio in Midjourney?
Use the --ar 16:9 command at the end of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get my image to have a specific aspect ratio like 16:9?
Use the --ar parameter followed by your desired aspect ratio. For example, --ar 16:9.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to generate a specific aspect ratio?
Use the --ar parameter and specify the aspect ratio you want, such as --ar 16:9.

---

Q: How do I get the same image in a different aspect ratio?
You can run the original prompt again and change the aspect ratio parameter, e.g. --ar 4:3. You may get similar but not exactly the same image.

---

Q: How do I get a specific output resolution like 1920x1080?
You cannot directly specify an output resolution in Midjourney. It generates images around 1024x1024 pixels. You will need to use an upscaling tool to increase the resolution.

---

Q: How do I generate an image with a specific aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9 for YouTube)?
You can specify an aspect ratio using the --ar parameter, e.g. --ar 16:9.

---

Q: I have jobs stuck in my queue for a long time. How can I cancel them?
React to the message with ‚ùå or right click > apps > cancel job

---

Q: How do I clear old stuck jobs?
If you have old stuck jobs that have been running for over 10 hours, contact a moderator and provide the job details. They may be able to clear stuck jobs over 10 hours old.

---

Q: My jobs are stuck at 93% for a long time. What should I do?
This is likely a visual glitch. Check /info to confirm if the job is actually running. If not, the job probably finished and you can recover it from your web gallery using /show.

---

Q: How do I cancel a running job?
To cancel a running job, react to the message with ‚ùå or right click > apps > cancel job

---

Q: I have old stuck or ghost jobs that won't finish generating or cancel. How do I clear them?
Contact support in the #member-support channel to request a queue reset. Moderators can clear any stuck jobs for you.

---

Q: Why did I receive an ephemeral job?
Ephemeral jobs occur when the AI filter flags your prompt or images as potentially inappropriate. This is not a punishment, just a precaution. You can use /show {jobID} to restore ephemeral jobs. If you believe the filter flagged your job in error, report the details in #ai-mod-bugs to help improve the system.

---

Q: How long does it take for jobs to start after using /imagine?
In fast mode, jobs should start within 1 minute. If a job does not start within 5 minutes, it has likely encountered an error. You can cancel the job and resubmit.

---

Q: Why are my jobs taking a long time?
Demand could be high, causing slower generations speeds. Check /info to ensure your jobs haven't failed.

---

Q: Why do I see "Paused" under my generation?
Jobs will pause if there are no GPUs currently available to process your generation. Your job will resume once a GPU becomes available again.

---

Q: Why is my queued job stuck?
Jobs can get stuck when there are technical issues. Cancel the stuck job by reacting to it with ‚ùå or right-clicking > Apps > Cancel Job. Contact support if jobs are stuck longer than 10 hours.

---

Q: Why do my generation requests sometimes result in "ephemeral" jobs that disappear?
Using softbanned words in your prompt can cause your jobs to be generated in "ephemeral" mode, meaning they disappear when your Discord session refreshes. To avoid this, work in direct messages (DMs) with the bot. Ephemeral jobs will still be in your web gallery.

---

Q: I have jobs stuck in my queue. Can I get them cleared?
If you have jobs running longer than 10 hours, contact a moderator to get them cleared from your queue.

---

Q: I have a job stuck for over 10 days. Can someone remove it?
Contact a moderator in <#958069758211797092> to reset your queue and remove stuck jobs over 10 hours.

---

Q: Why are jobs failing or getting stuck?
There are a few common reasons why jobs may fail or get stuck: 
 - High demand leading to throttling: Wait and try again later. Failed jobs do not count against your GPU hours.
 - Banned word or image in your prompt: Check if your prompt contains anything inappropriate and if so, remove it.
 - Website or service issue: MJ is working to resolve any issues, but may take time.

---

Q: Why is my relaxed generation taking so long?
Relaxed generation speed depends on many factors like current demand, how much you've used relaxed mode this month, and time of day. During busy periods, relaxed generations can take 10 minutes or more. Check your /info to ensure the job is still running.

---

Q: My jobs/generations are stuck or failing. What's going on?
This is likely due to high demand on the Midjourney servers, causing delays and failures. Try generating again later, and double check /info to see if any jobs failed. Failed jobs don't cost you anything. The Midjourney team is working to improve reliability and speed.

---

Q: Why can't I generate images or my jobs are stuck?
The bot may be experiencing hiccups. Try rerunning your prompt in a few minutes. You can check the status page (https://status.midjourney.com/) for updates.

---

Q: Why do I get the dreaded 'failed to fetch job' error?
This usually happens when MJ is experiencing an outage or system issue. Your job will not finish running. You need to resubmit your prompt once the system is back online.

---

Q: Why am I seeing "forbidden" or "only you can see this" under my images?
Your prompt likely contained a word that triggered the filter. These images will disappear when your Discord reloads. Working in DMs with the bot stops images from disappearing. You can also bring images back with /show <job_id>.

---

Q: Why isn't the text in my image rendering properly?
The AI model Midjourney uses is trained primarily for generating images, not text. Getting clear, legible text can take a lot of trial-and-error. Using an image editor is typically easier. Check out the guide here for tips: https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1025600359563001886

---

Q: Why can't I access the "Upscale" and "Beta Upscale Redo" options anymore?
The default Midjourney version recently changed to v5, which does not offer additional upscale options. To access upscaling, switch to v4 in /settings or add "--v 4" to the end of your prompts.

---

Q: Why are my images taking a long time to generate?
Image generation times can vary depending on demand and server load. Sometimes jobs get stuck - check /info to see status and consider canceling and re-running. If jobs are taking longer than 10 hours, ask support to check.

---

Q: I can't download images. Help!
The bulk downloader is currently broken. Try downloading in smaller batches, at off-peak hours. A website rebuild is in progress to fix this.

---

Q: I can't find my images! Where did they go?
Images are available for a limited time in Discord - download favorites promptly. Your web gallery holds all images indefinitely. Some were temporarily missing from early April - the issue is being investigated.

---

Q: Why can't I generate images on mobile?
Make sure you have the latest version of Discord installed and that you have enabled "Use slash commands and preview emojis, mentions, and markdown syntax as you type‚Äù in your Discord settings. You may also need to disable ‚ÄúUse the legacy chat input‚Äù in Accessibility settings.

---

Q: Why can't I get a high resolution image?
Midjourney generates images at 1024x1024 resolution. To get a higher resolution, you'll need to use a third-party upscaling tool like Gigapixel AI or Upscayl.

---

Q: Why are my images marked as "Only you can see this"?
Images marked this way were created ephemerally, meaning they contain words that could potentially generate inappropriate images. Ephemeral images disappear when you refresh Discord, but you can restore them using the /show command.

---

Q: Why can't I add images to collections or download batches of images?
There are some known issues with the website that the new web team is working to fix. Downloading smaller batch sizes or during off-peak hours may help in the meantime.

---

Q: U upscales or generates 4 new images instead.
Go to /settings and turn off "Remaster mode".

---

Q: Why did my image count decrease?
This is a known issue, the team is investigating and working to restore missing images.

---

Q: My images are not showing up in the web gallery, what's wrong?
There is currently an issue restoring some older images to the web gallery. The team is working to fix this and restore affected images. Check for updates in <#942231458918064148>.

---

Q: Why can't I access images I made over a month ago?
There are known issues accessing images from April 5-11. The developers are working to restore access. Check <#942231458918064148> for updates.

---

Q: Why is the quality option no longer in my settings?
The quality options were removed from settings because they did not do anything beyond quality 1 in versions 4 and 5. You can still set quality manually using --q.

---

Q: When I try to upscale, I get 4 new images instead. How do I fix this?
Go to /settings and turn off "Remaster Mode". This should return upscaling to normal.

---

Q: Why can't I generate certain content or use some words?
Midjourney aims to be inclusive and family-friendly. Nudity, gore, racism, toxicity, and other offensive content are not allowed.

---

Q: Why did an image disappear after I generated it?
Images marked as "only you can see this" are ephemeral images. This happens when your prompt uses a soft-banned word. Ephemeral images disappear when your Discord refreshes. To avoid this, generate your images by DMing the Midjourney bot. Images generated this way are not ephemeral. You can also save the image ID from the Midjourney website and use /show to retrieve the image in Discord.

---

Q: Why can't I save or download my images?
The download tool has known issues. Save smaller batches of images and try during off-peak hours. An updated downloader is being worked on.

---

Q: What do the U and V buttons under my images mean?
U refers to upscale - clicking the U buttons will provide higher resolution versions of that image panel. V refers to variation - clicking the V buttons will provide different stylistic variations of that image panel using the same prompt.

---

Q: Images from a date range are missing from my account.
This is a known issue currently being worked on. Check #announcements for updates.

---

Q: Why can't I upscale to 2048x2048?
The Beta Upscale option which allowed upscaling to 2048x2048 is only available for Model Version 4. The current default model is Version 5 which does not have this additional upscaler. You can switch back to Version 4 in /settings if you want access to Beta Upscale.

---

Q: Why is the U button giving me 4 new images instead of upscaling?
You likely have Remaster Mode enabled in your /settings. Deactivate Remaster Mode to resume normal upscaling behavior.

---

Q: Why do my messages disappear right after generating images?
You may have used a softbanned word, causing your messages to be generated in "ephemeral" mode. Ephemeral messages disappear when your Discord session refreshes. To avoid this, generate images in DMs with the Midjourney bot. The images will still save to your Midjourney gallery.

---

Q: Why is the bulk downloader not working?
The bulk downloader is currently experiencing issues, especially during high-demand periods. Try downloading in smaller batches or at off-peak hours. The team is rebuilding the website to improve functionality.

---

Q: Why did my images from the middle of my history disappear?
There is a known issue affecting images from April 5th-11th. The team is working to restore access within a week.

---

Q: Why can't I get 2048x2048 images?
Version 5.1 maxes out at 1024x1024. Use an external upscaler for higher resolution.

---

Q: Why can't I download my images in bulk?
The bulk image downloader is currently experiencing issues, especially during high-demand times. Download images in smaller batches or try at off-hours. A new web team is working to improve the site.

---

Q: Why don't I have the Beta Upscale option?
Beta Upscale is only available for Version 4 and below. Version 5.1 is the new default model. You can switch back to Version 4 in /settings if you prefer.

---

Q: Why do I get the message "original message deleted" when generating images?
This can happen when your prompt contains borderline content. Your images are still accessible in your web gallery. Use /show [job ID] to retrieve the message in Discord.

---

Q: Why can't I find my previous images?
Your images are stored in the Midjourney Gallery and Archive. You can access the Gallery at midjourney.com/app and the Archive at midjourney.com/app/archive. If you can't find your images, contact support.

---

Q: Why are my images stuck in the processing queue?
This usually happens when there is high demand on the Midjourney system. Your images will process once resources become available, which can take 10-45 minutes. If an image is stuck for over 10 hours, contact support to cancel the job.

---

Q: Why do my images always come out in portrait orientation? I want landscape.
Add "--ar 16:9" to your prompt to get landscape orientation.

---

Q: Why am I getting unusable text when generating an image?
Midjourney is not designed to generate accurate text. It will produce gibberish. We recommend adding text in an external image editor.

---

Q: Why did upscaling disappear in v5.1? How do I increase image size?
Upscaling is not available in v5.1. To increase image size, you will need to use a third-party image upscaler like Gigapixel AI. MJ is limited to output sizes of around 1000x1000 pixels.

---

Q: Why do my images get deleted after generating them?
Some prompts contain "ephemeral" words that will cause the image to be deleted for privacy/policy reasons. You can view and re-generate deleted images using /show [job ID].

---

Q: Why do my images have black bars or frames?
This happens when your aspect ratio (set with --ar) doesn't match the image size Midjourney generates. Either change your aspect ratio to match Midjourney's default (around 6:4) or crop the image to your desired size.

---

Q: Why can't I find my old generated images?
Your generated images are stored in your image gallery on the Midjourney website. Log in and navigate to `Your Profile` > `Image Gallery`.

---

Q: Where's the seed number?
To get the seed number for an image: 
 - Open the image on https://midjourney.com/app/
 - Click the three dots
 - Select "Copy"
 - The seed number will be in the prompt
 Alternatively, react to an image message in Discord with ‚úâÔ∏è and the bot will DM you the seed.

---

Q: What are the differences between U and V?
U = Upscale, isolates the image from the grid. V = generate Variations of the selected image.

---

Q: What does "--chaos" do?
The --chaos parameter introduces more variation and randomness into the generation. Higher numbers, like --chaos 10, will introduce more chaos than --chaos 5.

---

Q: What is the "--ar" parameter for?
The "--ar" parameter sets the aspect ratio of the generated image. For example, "--ar 16:9" will generate an image with a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.

---

Q: What is the difference between V5 and V5.1?
V5.1 is the latest version of Midjourney with improvements to the AI. V5 is an older version. You can select which version to use in the /settings menu.

---

Q: What do the /describe, /imagine, and /blend commands do?
These are commands used with the Midjourney bot: 
 /describe - Analyzes an uploaded image and provides keywords to describe the image. Useful for getting prompt ideas.
 /imagine - Generates images based on your text prompt. Used to create images from scratch without an image upload.
 /blend - Blends two uploaded images together based on your prompt. Used to combine images or make stylistic changes to an existing image.

---

Q: How do I use /describe?
/describe allows you to upload an image and receive four prompt suggestions based on that image. Select one of the prompts to generate variations of that image. /describe does not directly generate images, it provides prompts which you can then use to generate images.

---

Q: Can I use a seed with /blend?
No, you cannot use a seed with /blend. The results of a blend will be random.

---

Q: What does "--style raw" do?
"--style raw" gives you less of MJ's default stylistic choices and opinions. It will generate based primarily on your prompt without extra flourishes. This mode is available in v5.1.

---

Q: What is opinionated vs unopinionated mode?
Opinionated mode (v4 and v5.1 default) will make inferences about backgrounds, styles, etc based on your prompt. Unopinionated mode (v5 and v5.1 --style raw) requires you to specify more details and won't add as much on its own.

---

Q: What do the different version numbers mean (--v 3, --v 4, --v 5)?
The version numbers correspond to different models used by Midjourney to generate images. --v 5 and --v 5.1 are the latest models. --v 3 and --v 4 are older models that may produce different results.

---

Q: How do I enter multiple "--no" parameters?
Use a comma separated list for multiple --no parameters, e.g. "--no dog, cat, bird". Do not use a separate --no for each term, as that will likely overpower your prompt. Only use --no sparingly, as it can negatively impact your results.

---

Q: What does "featuring various elements related to the subject" mean?
This prompt phrase is too vague and will likely add unwanted noise to the generation. It is best removed.

---

Q: Do I need to specify --v 5 for every prompt to get version 5 results?
No, you can set --v 5 as your default engine in /settings. Then you only need to specify --v 5 in your prompt if you want to temporarily switch to a different version.

---

Q: What is Remix mode and how does it work?
Remix mode allows you to tweak your prompt to make small changes to an existing image. You can turn Remix mode on in /settings. Then when you click "V" for variations on an image, a prompt box will appear allowing you to edit the prompt. The image will regenerate based on your edited prompt.

---

Q: Why can't Midjourney generate the text I want?
Midjourney's AI is not able to generate custom typography well. Use an image editor to add text.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to place text exactly as I specify in my prompt?
Midjourney cannot accurately generate text. It is meant to create images, not text. You will need to add text to your images using an image editor.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney create multiple images in one frame?
This can happen unintentionally based on the prompt. To specify you only want one image, add ‚Äúisolated on white background‚Äù or a similar phrase to your prompt. You can then crop the single image you want from the result.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney keep changing the facial features or details of characters in my prompts?
Midjourney will recreate images from scratch and is not able to produce exact copies of people or characters. It relies on the description and details you provide in your prompt. Be as specific as possible by describing key facial and physical features to encourage consistency. Using reference images can also help.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney generate images with black lines or in a split-screen style when I don't specify that in my prompt?
Midjourney will sometimes generate images with a split-screen or black line style due to certain keywords in your prompt, like "comic". Remove or replace these words to avoid this effect. You can also add --no splitscreen to your prompt.

---

Q: Can Midjourney do quotes or text accurately?
No, Midjourney struggles with generating accurate text and spelling. It is best to add any text or quotes to images using an image editing tool.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney often not understand the essence of a prompt?
Midjourney is not designed to understand prompts in a semantic or contextual way. It interprets prompts based on its training data, so it may misunderstand or ignore certain words and phrases.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney struggle with generating certain subjects, like female characters or swimmers in swimsuits?
Midjourney has certain restrictions around nudity and sexually suggestive content. The AI model also has limited data on certain subjects, making them more difficult to generate. The Midjourney team is working to improve the model and relax restrictions where possible.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney struggle with custom text in images, or putting text on the right/intended item?
Midjourney has limited capabilities with text generation. It does not actually "read" or understand text, it only guesses based on its training data. For custom text, it's best to generate the image in Midjourney and add text with an external editing tool.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney struggle with hands, facial details, and anatomically correct body parts?
Midjourney is an AI model trained on a dataset of images. Its knowledge comes only from what was present in that dataset, and details like hands, faces, and anatomically correct bodies are complex and variable. Midjourney does not have a deep, generalized understanding of these parts, so it struggles to generate them accurately.

---

Q: Why did Midjourney suddenly stop generating certain content like bikinis?
Midjourney implements content filters and moderation to avoid generating offensive or inappropriate content. These filters are subject to change, and may block or limit previously allowed content.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney sometimes create images that are very different than my prompt?
Midjourney is still learning and improving. It may misunderstand or ignore parts of overly long or complex prompts. Keep your prompts concise while including important details. You may need to re-roll a few times to get closer to your vision.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney put text or props in my images when I don't want them?
Use the --no text parameter to avoid generated text. However, --no statements can sometimes damage your image so use sparingly. Analyze your prompt to determine what is triggering the unwanted elements and make adjustments. Sometimes using --no is unavoidable.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney keep changing parts of my image when I just want to change one specific thing?
Midjourney generates new images from scratch based on your prompt. It does not directly edit or modify existing images. The only way to make precise, targeted changes to an image is by using an external image editor. Midjourney can be used to re-generate an image with some differences, but it may change other parts of the image as well.

---

Q: Can Midjourney generate quotes or text in different languages?
No, Midjourney struggles with generating legible text and is not able to translate or generate text in different languages. You will need to add any text using an image editing tool.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to understand a pose like "the thinking man"?
Describe the pose in detail in your prompt. For example, "man standing with hand on chin, pondering". Be very specific about the position of the body, limbs, and facial expression. Midjourney struggles with implied or loosely described poses.

---

Q: How do I make Midjourney write text or letters accurately?
Midjourney struggles with text and will rarely generate text exactly. It can do a few characters at best. You're better off adding text in an external image editor.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney cut off parts of images or subjects? How can I fix this?
Midjourney may cut off parts of images or subjects for a few reasons: 
 - Your prompt does not specify to show the full subject. Add "full body" or "wide shot" to your prompt.
 - There are not enough details or objects specified in your prompt for Midjourney to fill the frame. Add more details and objects to give Midjourney more to work with.
 - The aspect ratio you chose is too narrow. Choose a wider aspect ratio like 16:9.
 - Increase --iw to rely more on your image reference (if using one).

---

Q: Why does MIdjourney struggle to generate certain fantastical subjects like centaurs, mermaids or multiple creatures together?
Midjourney is trained on a large dataset of existing images. If there are fewer examples of certain fantastical subjects, it will have more trouble generating them. It also has more trouble separating and generating distinct subjects in the same image. With more data and training, Midjourney should improve at generating a wider range of subjects.

---

Q: Why does Midjourney struggle with text and spelling?
Midjourney is an image generation model, not a natural language model. It has not been optimized for understanding language or writing text. Simple brand names or short phrases may work, but longer, coherent sentences and paragraphs are beyond its current capabilities. For now, we recommend adding any necessary text to your images using a design program.

---

Q: How do I see my previous images?
You can view your previous images at https://www.midjourney.com/app/ in your image gallery. You may need to sign in with your Discord account.

---

Q: How do I generate an image?
Type "/imagine" followed by your prompt.

Use the /info command. It will show your "Fast Time Remaining" which indicates how many minutes of generation time you have left. Most images take around 1 minute so you can estimate from there.

---

Q: How do I generate an image from a URL or my computer?
To use an image as a prompt: 
 1. Get the direct image link (ends in .jpeg, .png, or .webp)
 2. Paste that link after /imagine to generate an image
 If the image is on your computer:
 1. Send the image as a message to <@936929561302675456>
 2. Right-click the image and select "Copy Link" (or "Copy Image Address" if in browser)
 3. Paste that link after /imagine to generate an image

---

Q: How do I upscale in version 5?
In version 5, "upscale" simply pulls out one image from the generated grid. For actual larger sizes than 1024x1024, use an external upscaler.

---

Q: How do I find images I've generated?
Your images are stored on https://www.midjourney.com/app/ in your gallery and archive.

---

Q: How do I use an image to inspire new images?
You can provide image URLs or upload images as inspiration using the instructions at <#1026944423692619878>. However, Midjourney will generate new images from scratch and the results may look quite different from your source images.

---

Q: How do I upload an image?
To use an image link in your prompt: 
 Discord (desktop): Right-click > Copy Link (not Copy Message Link)
 Discord (web): Click to expand image > Right-click > Copy Image Address

You can add --v 5 to the end of your prompt or change your default version in /settings to --v 5.

---

Q: How do I generate an image with multiple views of the same subject, like front and side profile?
Start your prompt with "Character reference sheet of [subject name]"

---

Q: How do I get an image to look more realistic?
Start your prompt with "photograph of" instead of "realistic". Realistic prompts do not produce photographic results.

---

Q: How do I generate text in an image?
Midjourney struggles with generating legible text. It is best to generate images without text and add text using design software.

---

Q: How do I get a close up or cropped image?
Use descriptive terms in your prompt like "close up", "cropped", "tight shot", "zoom in".

---

Q: How do I share my images?
To share images, you can copy and paste them into the chat or upload them to a file sharing service and share the link.

---

Q: How do I get more details in images like grass and leaves?
Adding more specific descriptions of the details you want, like mentioning blades of grass or individual leaves, may help get more details. You can also try different values for --stylize and --quality.

---

Q: How do I resize an image without generating an entirely new image?
Midjourney currently does not have the capability to resize existing images. It can only generate new images. You may need to resize the image using an external image editor.

---

Q: How do I share an image in the chat?
You can share an image by uploading it and then right-clicking or long-pressing to copy the image link. Paste that link into the chat.

---

Q: How do I edit an existing image?
You can't directly edit images in Midjourney. It generates new images from scratch based on your prompts and any provided references. You'll need to use an external image editing tool.

---

Q: How do I create a logo?
Use "icon" or "vector design" instead of "logo" in your prompt. Midjourney struggles with text so a logo prompt may add too much extra text.

---

Q: How do I create a stereoscopic 3D image?
Midjourney cannot generate true stereoscopic 3D images. You'll need to use a 3D rendering tool for that.

---

Q: How do I add a speech bubble to an image?
It is very difficult to get MJ to generate speech bubbles and text. It is recommended to add these elements using photo editing software after generating your image.

---

Q: How do I set my default image version?
You can set your default version in /settings. The options are v3, v4, v5, v5.1, and niji (for anime style).

---

Q: How do I use an image as input to generate a new image?
You can include image URLs at the beginning of your text prompt. Describe what you want the final image to be in the text portion of the prompt.

---

Q: How do I generate images of specific subjects like scorpions?
Midjourney has limited knowledge of some subjects, like scorpions. Provide an image reference of the subject, and describe the subject in detail in your prompt using its key attributes and features. However, even with a lot of guidance, Midjourney may still struggle with some subjects.

---

Q: How do I modify or re-create an existing image?
Midjourney cannot edit or modify existing images. It creates new images from text prompts and image references.

---

Q: How do I weight an image in v5?
Use the --iw parameter, for example --iw 1.5. Values range from 0 to 2.

---

Q: How do I get a seamless tileable image?
Add "--tile" at the end of your prompt. Don't add terms like "seamless" or "wallpaper" which may confuse Midjourney.

---

Q: How do I get the camera to zoom in even tighter?
Try using terms like "extreme closeup" or "macro shot" in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get an exact copy of my reference image?
You can't. Midjourney creates new images, it is not a photoshop filter. It will not produce an exact copy of your reference image.

---

Q: How do I add text to an image?
It is difficult for MJ to add text to images. It is best to add text afterwards using a photo editor.

---

Q: How do I get full body or landscape images?
Add "full body", "full length", or a wide aspect ratio like 16:9 to your prompt. You can also describe the environment around the subject.

---

Q: How do I get an image that looks like a photograph?
Start your prompt with "photograph of" or "photo of".

---

Q: How do I get an image with a specific color scheme?
It is difficult to specify exact colors. You can try mentioning the general color palette you want, e.g. "warm colors" or "muted tones". An image reference with your desired color scheme may also help guide the result.

---

Q: How do I generate a larger image?
Midjourney generates images up to 1024x1024 pixels. To get a larger image, you will need to use an external image upscaler. Some free options include Gigapixel AI and Cupscale.

---

Q: How do I get a profile picture that actually looks like me?
This can be challenging, as Midjourney will generate a new face rather than replicating your exact features. Provide a high-quality front-facing photo of yourself and set the image weight ( --iw ) to 2. Describe your most distinctive features in the prompt. Be prepared to remix and re-roll many times to get a result you like.

---

Q: How do I change the colors of a generated image?
Midjourney cannot directly edit or change the colors of a generated image. You will need to use an image editing tool like Photoshop or GIMP to change the colors.

---

Q: Where do generated images appear?
Images will appear in the same channel that you issued the /imagine command. You can also view all your generated images on midjourney.com.

---

Q: How do I generate images from different perspectives or angles?
Use terms like "aerial view", "profile view", "close-up view" to specify the perspective you want. You may need to provide additional details about what is in the scene.

---

Q: How do I save my images?
To save a Midjourney image, click the "Web" button below the image which will open it in a new tab. Then you can right-click and save the image. Alternatively, you can click the three dots (...) and select "Save image as...".

---

Q: How do I generate an exact replica of an existing product or logo?
You can't. MJ will always redraw and modify images. It is not designed to exactly replicate existing images or products.

---

Q: How do I re-generate an existing image but with small tweaks?
To re-generate an existing Midjourney image with small changes, turn on the Remix option in your Settings. Then when you click the V (variations) button on an image, it will open a prompt editor and allow you to make changes to the original prompt. Midjourney will then re-generate based on your edited prompt. Note that larger changes may result in a very different image from your starting point. Remix works best for minor tweaks.

---

Q: How do I increase the image size or resolution?
You cannot directly increase the image size or resolution within Midjourney. The maximum size is 1024x1024 pixels. To get a larger size, you will need to use an external image upscaling tool like Gigapixel AI or Topaz Gigapixel.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting banned or blocked from prompts?
There are a few possible reasons you may be getting banned or blocked from prompts: 
 - The new AI word filter is still learning and can make incorrect calls at times. Appeal the prompt and report appeals that were wrong in <#1100553606761041991>.
 - You retried a banned prompt too many times. Do not keep entering the same prompt.
 - Your prompt actually does violate our community guidelines or content policies. Review them at https://www.midjourney.com/policy/content

---

Q: My prompt is stuck. What do I do?
Check /info to see if the job is still running. If not, it likely failed or finished - check your web gallery. Under high demand, prompts can take longer. Be patient.

---

Q: Why are my prompts stuck on 'Waiting to start'?
This can happen when the servers are under high load. Wait for up to an hour for the job to start, if it's still stuck reach out to support. The jobs do not use your GPU time while waiting.

---

Q: Why can't I add images into my prompts?
You can't drag and drop images directly into prompts. Use /imagine and add the image URL at the end of your prompt text. Make sure the link ends in an image extension like .jpg, .png, or .gif.

---

Q: Why are my prompts disappearing from Discord?
These are ephemeral images which disappear when you refresh Discord. To prevent this, generate images by DMing the bot.

---

Q: I used the same prompt and seed but got the same image. Why did this happen?
Using the same seed will generate the same or highly similar images. Change or remove the seed to get more variety.

---

Q: Why can't I appeal prompts that were blocked?
The appeal system is under high load. Post the full prompt in <#1100553606761041991> if you believe it should not have been blocked.

---

Q: I need help with my prompt
Ask in the #prompt-chat channel. Provide as much detail about your prompt and desired result as possible. The experts there can help refine your prompt to get better results.

---

Q: Why are my prompts being flagged even though they don't seem to violate any rules?
Midjourney uses AI filters that are still learning and can sometimes flag prompts incorrectly. Be sure to appeal any false positives.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting warnings on my prompts?
The new moderator AI filter is still learning, so it may incorrectly flag some prompts. To help improve the system, report your prompts in <#1100553606761041991>. Getting warnings will not necessarily lead to a ban, but continued violations of the MJ terms of service could result in revoked access.

---

Q: Why is the bot responding slowly?
The bot can get slower during peak hours or when demand on the servers is high. You can check server status at https://status.midjourney.com/. Using /fast mode will generate images faster.

---

Q: Why does the image filter block my prompts?
The image filter uses Google SafeSearch which can be oversensitive. The Midjourney team is working to improve the filter. You can appeal incorrect blocks by clicking "Appeal" or report them to help improve the system. Avoid nudity, gore, hate speech, and illegal content.

---

Q: Why does my prompt have strange letters/words in it?
The AI struggles with accurately generating text. Add "--no text" to your prompt to avoid strange letters/words.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting an "internal error" after submitting my prompt?
An "internal error" message usually indicates a temporary glitch with Midjourney. Wait a few moments and submit your prompt again. If issues continue, contact Midjourney support.

---

Q: Why don't my prompts with "bikini" generate women in bikinis anymore?
Midjourney's content filters have likely been updated to avoid generating certain types of images. Using words like "bikini" in your prompts may trigger these filters.

---

Q: My prompts won‚Äôt load or are failing. What‚Äôs happening?
Midjourney is likely experiencing temporary technical issues or disruption of service. The developers are aware of the issue and working to resolve it. Please check the status channels for updates.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting errors mentioning "banned words" even though my prompt seems fine?
Midjourney uses an automated filter to detect potentially objectionable content. Sometimes this filter incorrectly flags prompts that do not actually violate the content policy. You can appeal these errors or report incorrect flags to improve the filter.

---

Q: Why is the AI struggling with a prompt?
The prompt may be too complex, contradictory, or include elements the AI has trouble with like hands or faces. Simplify your prompt, check for contradictions, or provide more details and image references. The AI is still learning, so some concepts remain challenging.

---

Q: Why do I get random or unexpected results from my prompt?
There are a few possible reasons you may get unexpected results: 
 1. Your prompt is too vague or open-ended. Try to be as specific as possible in describing what you want to see.
 2. You have too many concepts or subjects in one prompt. It is difficult for Midjourney to balance and cohesively combine multiple complex subjects. Break your prompt into separate, focused ones.
 3. You are using contradictory or conflicting terms that confuse Midjourney. Review your prompt and remove or clarify any ambiguous or contradictory terms.
 4. Midjourney's training data and knowledge is limited. It may have gaps or inaccuracies that lead to unexpected results, especially for more complex or niche subjects. You may need to further guide Midjourney by providing reference images and re-prompting multiple times.
 5. There are inconsistencies in Midjourney's generation that can lead to random or strange results, especially when re-using the same prompt multiple times. Re-prompting can sometimes yield better results.

---

Q: My prompt is being flagged as explicit, why is this happening?
The AI moderation system is still learning and may occasionally flag prompts incorrectly. You can appeal the decision if you believe it was made in error. The system is actively being improved to reduce false positives.

---

Q: Why do my image prompts result in different subjects?
Midjourney cannot generate an exact copy of the image you provide. It will reimagine the image subject based on your prompt. Provide more details about the subject in your prompt to get better likeness.

---

Q: Does prompt order matter?
The order of words and phrases in your prompt can have some effect, but generally speaking, the effect is minor. MJ gives higher priority to elements mentioned earlier in the prompt, but re-rolling can produce different results regardless of order. For the most part, prompt order will not make or break an MJ generation.

---

Q: My prompts are being flagged as invalid, what's wrong?
There is likely an error in the syntax or parameters used. Double check that all parameters are spelled correctly and separated by spaces.

---

Q: Why can't I run prompts?
Make sure you are using the proper syntax like /imagine. Copying and pasting the prompt may result in errors. Type the prompt manually to ensure there are no issues.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting female results when I specify "male" in my prompt?
MJ has certain styles and archetypes strongly associated with females. To counter this, be very descriptive about the masculine traits and details you want to see. You may also want to specify an archetype strongly associated with males, like "action hero". Using image references of males can further help guide MJ.

---

Q: How do I recover or find my old prompts and images?
Your generated images and prompts are saved to your web gallery at midjourney.com. Log in with your Discord account to access your full history of creations. If images are missing or not loading, the site may be experiencing high demand. Try again later.

---

Q: How do I get help with my prompts?

---

Q: My prompt isn't generating the image I want. How can I improve it?
The members in <#992207085146222713> are experts in crafting prompts and can help you refine yours to get better results.

---

Q: How do I see my images or past prompts?
Go to https://www.midjourney.com/app/ to view your gallery and see all past prompts and images.

---

Q: How much access do Pro members have to private prompts and uploaded images?
Pro members have access to stealth mode which allows private prompts and uploaded images to remain unseen by the public. Images generated in stealth mode on private Discord servers or in DMs with the bot will not appear on the Midjourney website or in public Discord channels.

---

Q: How do I write a prompt with multiple reference images?
To use multiple reference images in your Midjourney prompt, include the links to each image, followed by your text prompt: 
 https://link1.jpg
 https://link2.png
 A woman swimming in a lake during sunset.
 Midjourney will take inspiration and details from all of the provided images to generate a new result based on your overall prompt.

---

Q: How do I include an artist's style in my prompt?
You can include an artist's style in your prompt using: 
 - In the style of [artist name]
 - Designed by [artist name]
 - Illustration by [artist name]
 - [artist name] painting of [your prompt subject]
 For well-known artists like Bob Ross, you may be able to just include their name, e.g. "Bob Ross painting of happy little trees"

---

Q: How do I specify a color in my prompt?
You cannot use hex color codes in Midjourney. Use descriptive color names like "blue" or "forest green" in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I pass multiple images to my prompt?
You can pass multiple images to your prompt by including the image links at the beginning of your prompt, with a space between each link. For example: 
 `/imagine https://example.com/image1.jpg https://example.com/image2.jpg prompt describing the images`
 Midjourney will use these images as references to generate new variations. Be sure to also include a text prompt describing what you want in the image.

---

Q: How do I get facial features like eyes early in the prompt?
Specifically mention the facial features at the beginning of the prompt, e.g. "white male with green eyes and messy hair". Put the most important attributes first.

---

Q: How many reference images can I include in my prompt?
You can include up to 8 reference image URLs in your prompt. However, using too many reference images can reduce Midjourney's creativity.

---

Q: How do I upload a reference image to base my prompt on?
You can upload an image to your Midjourney account or host it externally. Then, paste the image URL at the beginning of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get the AI to stay true to an image prompt?
Use high image weights, blending, or describing the image in your prompt. Image weights (e.g. --iw 2) tell the AI to weigh the image reference heavily. Blending combines two images. Describing the image in your prompt gives the AI more details about the image.

---

Q: How do I get the model to match my prompt? It keeps drawing something else.
Keep your prompt simple and direct. Focus on describing what you want to see rather than what it actually is. The prompts aspects that comes first are weighted more heavily, so place important elements up front.

---

Q: How do I apply different image weights to different image prompts?
You can't apply multiple image weights in a single prompt. Image weight, specified by --iw, applies to all image references in the prompt. To achieve different weights, you'll need to run separate prompts for each image reference.

---

Q: How do I create a consistent style across multiple prompts?
Include specific style keywords, artist names, and descriptions in all of your prompts to achieve a consistent style. For example, include terms like "impressionism", "watercolor", "Monet" in multiple prompts. The more details you provide, the more consistent the style will be.

---

Q: How do I generate a prompt for an avatar/character?
Use descriptive words to generate a character portrait. For example: 
 /imagine a sorcerer with pale blue skin and white hair sitting in a dimly lit tavern

---

Q: Hello what command do I use for it to type and specific words that I say
Midjourney does not have a command for generating specific text. It is not able to produce exact text.

---

Q: How do I create an image with multiple weighted prompts?
Use double colons :: to separate weighted prompts, e.g. "cat ::1.5, dog ::0.5". There should be no space between the :: and the number.

---

Q: How do I get inspiration for prompts?
Check out the content on the Midjourney website or browse the public gallery for ideas. You can also try the /describe feature on images you find interesting to get prompt suggestions.

---

Q: How do I prompt the bot to use one of my own images?
You can copy the image URL or embed the image in Discord. Paste the URL at the beginning of your text prompt followed by a space. Describe what you want the image to look like.

---

Q: How do I make the AI forget my previous prompt?
The AI does not actually remember your previous prompts. For each new prompt, it generates a new image from scratch based on your current prompt. However, if your new prompt is very similar to a previous one, you may get similar results. To get more varied results, try changing more details in your prompt or using the "Re-roll" button.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting captchas when generating images?
The captcha system is new and still being optimized. Captchas are meant to prevent abuse from automated systems and may appear too frequently for some users. The team is working to improve the system and reduce captchas for regular users.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting asked if I'm human?
The captcha system is still being tuned to appear less frequently. For now, just solve the captcha when it appears.

---

Q: Why are there extra parts (limbs, tails) on some of my images?
The AI still struggles with anatomy and realism in some generations. The pros at <#992207085146222713> may have tips for improving your prompts to minimize unwanted artifacts.

---

Q: Why do I have a watermark on my image?
Watermarks are added randomly by the AI and are not actually part of your prompt. You can add --no watermark to your prompt to prevent watermarks from appearing.

---

Q: Why do my images contain random text?
The AI generates text to match the style of images it has seen, but it does not actually understand language. Use --no text at the end of your prompt to avoid generating text.

---

Q: Why do I have to click "Allow" every time I generate multiple images?
The "Allow" prompt appears when you generate many images at once to prevent overuse. There is currently no way to disable this prompt.

---

Q: Why are my images coming out in a different size than expected?
You may be using an older version of Midjourney that does not support the image size you want. Upgrading to the latest version is recommended. You can also use an external upscaling service.

---

Q: Why are my generation results poor quality or inaccurate?
This is often caused by issues with your prompt. Share your prompt and results in #prompt-help and members can help refine your prompt to get better results.

---

Q: Why do my variations all look the same?
The variations feature produces images that are slightly different from each other. For more dramatic changes, use the chaos feature by adding --c (value from 0-100) to your prompt.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same results when generating new images?
You likely need to provide Midjourney with more details and instructions in your prompt. Be very specific about what you want to see in the image. Midjourney relies heavily on the information you provide.

---

Q: Why can't I get the AI to replicate an exact image or object?
Midjourney is designed to generate new unique images, not directly copy or replicate an existing image. It can take a reference image as inspiration, but the output will always be a new creation.

---

Q: Why does the AI keep generating the same or similar results over and over?
The AI generates images based on your prompt. If you use the same or similar prompts, it will continue generating the same or similar results. To get more variety, try different prompts with different wording, references, and styles.

---

Q: Why does the AI keep putting text or weird symbols in my images?
Midjourney was trained on a dataset with a lot of samples including text. To avoid text, add "--no text" or "--no words" to your prompt.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting kids in my images when I don't specify them?
You may have used terms like "cute" or "adorable" in your prompt which Midjourney associates more with children. Try removing those terms or being more specific in describing the subject you actually want.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same elements like sneakers in unrelated images?
Midjourney associates certain objects, words or concepts together based on its training data. For example, it may have learned to associate the color pink with shoes. To avoid unwanted associations, be very specific in your prompts and provide details about exactly what you want to see. You can also try using `--no [element]` to negatively prompt against things you don't want.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same kinds of images?
Midjourney is trained on existing images, so it is limited to what it has seen before. Be very specific in your prompts and provide reference images to guide the AI. Repeat key terms and concepts to reinforce what you want to see.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting cartoony results when I want photorealism?
Start your prompt with "photograph of" to get more photorealistic results.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting distorted or disfigured results?
MJ is trained on a limited dataset and struggles with some subjects like anatomy, curves, and complex shapes. Remove overly detailed descriptions from your prompt and keep it simple. You may need to do some retouching to your images. Use the /describe tool to help build your prompt.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting unwanted text or words in my image?
The language in your prompt may be confusing Midjourney or triggering unwanted text. Try rewording your prompt to be more direct and concise. You can also add "--no text" to your prompt to remove unwanted text.

---

Q: Why do my images not resemble the image I uploaded?
Midjourney does not copy images exactly. It uses your uploaded image and prompt as inspiration to create something new. The output will not look exactly like your input image.

---

Q: Why are my upscales looking different than the parent?
Upscales in V4 will modify the image slightly. Upscales in V5 will look the same as the parent image.

---

Q: Why do I see a grid or watermark-like pattern in my image?
This can happen when training images used by MJ had similar watermarks or grids. To avoid this, use ‚Äú--no watermark‚Äù in your prompt.

---

Q: Why can't I get an exact copy of an image I provide as reference?
Midjourney is designed to create new images inspired by your prompts and references. It cannot make an exact copy of an input image.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same image when I use a seed?
Seeds randomly generate noise that Midjourney uses as a starting point. If you use the same seed and prompt, you'll get similar results. Change your prompt significantly to get different images from the same seed.

---

Q: Why do I get split or divided images instead of a single image?
Words like "comic", "split screen" or "panels" in your prompt can trigger split images. Remove these words or add "--no split screen" to your prompt.

---

Q: Why do I get strange artifacts or extra limbs in my images?
MJ has no sense of anatomy or correctness. It associates words and phrases to visual styles, but can't guarantee accuracy. To avoid extra limbs or artifacts, focus your prompt on the specific pose, action or body part you want to see. The more specific you are, the less room for error.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same generic face in my Midjourney images?
Midjourney may default to generic faces if you do not provide enough facial details in your prompt. Be sure to describe key facial features like eye shape and color, nose shape, lip shape, face shape, etc. You can also describe a specific person as a reference to help guide Midjourney. The more details the better.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting split screen or comic panel images?
Words like "comic", "panel", or "split screen" in your prompt may trigger this. Remove them or add "--no split screen".

---

Q: Why do I keep getting pictures of people instead of what I'm actually trying to generate?
This usually happens when your prompt is too vague or broad. MJ will default to a generic subject like a person. You need to be more specific in your prompt by describing exactly what you want to see. Include more details about the subject, style, environment, mood, etc. The more specific your prompt is, the less likely MJ is to default to a generic subject.

---

Q: Why isn't my seed producing the same result?
Seeds only produce the exact same result if the prompt is identical. Any changes to the prompt, even small ones, can produce a very different result even with the same seed. Midjourney also uses a different process for the initial image generation versus re-generating an image, which can impact results.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting images with "watermark" on them?
MJ's training data includes many stock photos, so it will sometimes generate these in its images. There's no surefire way to avoid this, but adding "--no watermark" to the end of your prompt may help reduce them.

---

Q: Why do I keep getting the same result when rerolling?
Your prompt may be too specific, not leaving room for much variation. Try making your prompt more open-ended or increasing the chaos/randomness. You can also try changing or removing parts of the prompt to get different results.

---

Q: Why don't my uploaded images look the same in the result?
Midjourney always creates a new image and does not edit or filter your uploaded images. It uses the image as inspiration and for reference, but the result will be an entirely new creation.

---

---

Q: How do I install the InsightFaceSwap bot?
The InsightFaceSwap bot is not related to Midjourney. Midjourney is an AI that generates images from text prompts.

---

Q: How do I zoom out to show a subject's full body?
Add "full body view" or "entire [subject]" at the beginning of your prompt. Describe the subject's clothing and environment to give Midjourney more context. Zooming out can be difficult, so you may need to experiment with different prompts.

---

Q: How do I get a really close version of myself in AI art?
To get AI art that resembles yourself closely: 
 - Use multiple selfie image references in your prompt

 - Describe your facial features, hair, and other attributes in the prompt
 - Reference the same or similar style in each prompt to maintain consistency
 --

---

Q: How do I avoid getting a character's head cut off?

You can find inspiration from the Midjourney explore page, image prompts, and conversations with other users.

---

Q: How do I get a wide angle or full body shot?
Add "full body shot", "full length", or "wide angle" near the beginning of your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get more varied facial expressions?
To get more varied facial expressions, try describing the mood or emotion you want to convey, for example: 
 Happy laughing sad angry pensive confused sultry seductive confidence scared
 You can also try using /describe on images of expressions you want and incorporate those words into your prompt.

---

Q: How do I generate a portrait of someone who is afraid or fearful?
To generate a fearful facial expression, include descriptors like "fearful gaze", "worried eyes", or "apprehensive". You may also want to describe a fearful pose or context to help convey the emotion.

---

Q: How do I get a character in a kneeling position?
Try "seiza kneeling" or "praying" in your prompt. You may need to reroll several times.

---

Q: How do I describe relative positions of objects?
Be as specific as possible in describing positions, e.g. "basil leaves with dewdrops are lying on top of a mound of tzatziki in a glass bowl on a wooden table". However, MJ may still reinterpret the composition. You can try photobashing a mock-up to provide more direction.

---

Q: How do I specify a pose or camera angle?
Include descriptions like "closeup", "portrait", "full body", "wide angle", or "left of frame" at the beginning of your prompt. For example, `closeup of a wizard casting a spell, dramatic lighting, fantasy style`

---

Q: How do I get the bot to generate a specific word?
Midjourney cannot generate exact text. It is designed to create images, not text. You will need to add any text in a separate graphics editor.

---

Q: How do I generate a side view of a subject?
Include "side view" or "profile view" in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get a catfish and not a cat-fish hybrid?
Be very specific in describing a catfish, e.g. "a brown bullhead catfish with barbels around its mouth, resting on a riverbed". Avoid mentioning cats. You may also want to search for image references of catfish to include.

---

Q: Why is the AI struggling with certain body positions like kneeling?
The AI has limited data on some poses and positions, so it has trouble generating them. You may need to be very specific in your prompt, provide references images, and try re-rolling the prompt multiple times to get the position you want. Some tips: 
 - Say "kneeling" rather than "on knees"
 - Specify the surface, e.g. "kneeling on tatami mat"
 - Add "seiza kneeling" for a traditional Japanese kneeling pose
 - Include reference images of the pose
 - Reroll the prompt multiple times to allow the AI to explore different options

---

Q: How do I get a character to look at their forearm?
You can try prompts like "checks his watch" or describe the action, e.g. "looking down at his forearm". However, getting characters into specific poses can be challenging.

---

Q: How do I get a fur coat?
Describe the coat in your prompt, e.g. "wearing a fur coat" or "dressed in a fur coat". Make sure to specify the material, e.g. "fox fur coat".

---

Q: How do I get brighter lighting or change the camera angle?
Use "bright daylight", "dramatic lighting", "closeup shot", "low angle" or "high angle". Specifying the light source, like "sunlight" or "spotlight" can also help.

---

Q: How do I get a character to face the camera?
Use phrases like "looking at camera" or "making eye contact with viewer" in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get a side view of a character rather than a 3/4 view?
Using ‚Äúprofile view‚Äù or ‚Äúside view‚Äù in your prompt may help. Also describing what the character is standing on and their surroundings can provide more context for Midjourney to generate a side view.

---

Q: How do I get a metal dragon?
Include the word "metal" or "metallic" in your prompt to specify you want a metal dragon. You may also want to include words like "steel" or "titanium". Without specific descriptors, Midjourney will default to a standard flesh and blood dragon.

---

Q: How do I get giant characters or objects?
Use words like "huge", "enormous", "gigantic", or "massive" in your prompt to specify you want an upscaled character or object. This signals to Midjourney that the subject should be much larger than normal.

---

Q: How do I generate a specific object e.g. frog on skull?
Provide very specific details and references. For example, "illustration of a frog sitting on top of a human skull". Be prepared to try multiple prompts and do some editing. Consistent objects are hard for AI to generate.

---

Q: How do I get the subject to face the camera?
Include "looking at the camera" or "facing the viewer" in your prompt.

---

Q: How do I get the seed?
To get the seed for an image, react to the image using the envelope emoji (‚úâÔ∏è). The Midjourney bot will then DM you the details for that image, including the seed.

---

Q: How do I generate fantasy creatures?
Use references like "mythical", "fantastical" or creature names from mythology and fantasy works. For example, "centaur", "pegasus", "griffin". You may need to experiment with different words to find what works.

---

Q: How do I get the AI to understand what I want?
To help the AI understand what you want in an image, try the following: 
 - Keep your prompts short, direct and concise. Describe what you see, not what something is.
 - Place the most important elements of your prompt at the beginning. The AI prioritizes the first parts of the prompt.
 - Don't use "no", "without" or "none". The AI does not fully understand negatives. Use "--no" instead.
 - Experiment with different prompts and settings. The results are not always predictable.
 - Search for examples of what others have rendered using similar keywords. This can provide prompt inspiration.
 - Use "/describe" on example images to find the right keywords and style to describe what you want.

---

Q: How do I get a realistic version of my face? I uploaded some photos a while ago but the results were nothing like me.
Midjourney does not generate exact copies or replicas. It uses your input images as references to create new images. You will not get an exact likeness of yourself, your loved ones, objects, characters, pets or celebrities. The more specific details you provide in your prompt about the subject's characteristics, the more influence it may have.

---

Q: How do I get accurate details for real-world objects like instruments?
Midjourney has limited ability to generate highly accurate details for complex real-world objects. It was trained on a general dataset and does not have specialized knowledge of most objects. The results will often be unrealistic or inaccurate.

---

Q: How do I get my character to have long hair?
To specify long hair in your prompt, include terms like "long hair" or "with long flowing hair" at the beginning of your prompt. The elements at the start of your prompt have the highest priority, so placing these terms first will help Midjourney focus on long hair for your character.

---

Q: How do I avoid getting boring, generic results?
Be very specific in your prompts. Include details about colors, lighting, composition, mood, and style. You can also experiment with different model versions and the --s (stylize) parameter. Higher --s values may produce more interesting results, but lower values give you more control.

---

Q: How do I do a portrait or get a subject facing the camera?
Use "portrait" or "facing the camera/viewer" in your prompt.

---

Q: Can I use images created by Midjourney commercially?
As a paying member, you have commercial rights to images you generate. You have no rights over images generated by other users. See the full Terms of Service for details: https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service#4-copyright-and-trademark.

---

Q: How do I upload an image to use in Midjourney?
To use an image in Midjourney, follow these steps: 
 1. Send the image as a message to the Midjourney bot <@936929561302675456>. You must send the image before interacting with it.
 2. Right-click the image and select "Copy Link" (not "Copy Message Link")
 3. Use /imagine followed by the image link in your prompt
 For example:
 /imagine https://example.com/myimage.png
 A scenic landscape

---

Q: How do I submit image prompts to Midjourney?
You need to upload the image and send it as a message, then use the link that ends in .png or .jpg in your prompt. On desktop, right click and select "Copy Link". On mobile, tap and hold then select "Copy Media Link".

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to generate symmetry or line up features in an image?
Midjourney has trouble precisely aligning features or creating perfect symmetry. You can try using "symmetry" in your prompt, but the results may still be imperfect. For the best results, you can make final edits in an image editing tool.

---

Q: How do I use an image as a reference or baseline in Midjourney?
To use an image as a reference in Midjourney, include the link to your image at the beginning of your prompt, followed by a textual description. For example: 
 https://link.to/image
 A woman swimming in a lake during sunset.
 Midjourney will use details from your image as inspiration and guidance to generate a new, related image based on your prompt.

---

Q: What is RAW mode in Midjourney?
RAW mode, specified with the --style raw parameter, tells Midjourney to be less opinionated in how it interprets your prompt. It will generate an image more literally based on your prompt without as much of its own stylistic flair. The results may be simpler but will follow your prompt more closely.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to create a specific character accurately?
Midjourney cannot create an exact likeness of a character. It will generate images that are roughly inspired by the prompt. To get closer, provide detailed description and reference images.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to generate a specific subject (person, object) exactly as in a reference photo?
Midjourney does not simply filter reference images. It reinterprets them to create new images. You may get closer by providing multiple reference images, but the output will never perfectly match your references. For precise edits, use Photoshop or another image editor.

---

Q: How do I blend two images together in Midjourney?
You can use the /blend function in Midjourney to blend two images together. To use /blend: 
 1. Generate two images using /imagine
 2. Click on the first image and select "Blend"
 3. Paste the link to the second image in the field
 4. A new image will be generated blending the two input images.
 5. You can then make variations of the blended image to refine it.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to generate images with specific colors?
You can specify colors in your prompt using the real names of colors e.g. "orange and purple". You can also add a reference image with a specific color palette and Midjourney will use those colors.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to generate a full-length image instead of cropping the subject?
Start your prompt with "full body view of" followed by your subject description. Also specify the subject's relationship to the background/environment. For example, "full body view of a woman standing in a forest clearing".

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to avoid including certain objects or elements in my images?
Use "--no" followed by the objects/elements you want to avoid. For example, "--no windows" or "--no streetlights".

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to give me an exact likeness or copy my input photo?
Midjourney does not produce exact copies or likenesses. It uses input images and text prompts as inspiration to create new images. The output will always be a reimagined version of the input, not an exact clone or edit.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to use an uploaded image as a reference without changing it significantly?
You can't. Midjourney always creates a new image and does not copy the reference image exactly. The closer the subject is to archetypes in Midjourney's training data, the more similar the result may be. Adjust the prompt and image weight to get the best result.

---

Q: How do I remove something from an image Midjourney generated?
You can't. Midjourney creates new images from scratch and does not provide tools to edit existing images. Use Photoshop or another image editor to modify the image.

---

Q: How do I get Midjourney to understand what a "mockup" is?
Midjourney does not actually understand the concept of a mockup. You will need to describe the specific image you want to see and then add mockup elements manually using image editing software.

---

Q: Can I get Midjourney to create the same character in different scenes?
It is difficult for Midjourney to generate the exact same character across different images. However, you can use image references and detailed text descriptions to create similar characters. Include characteristic details about the character's appearance, expression, pose, clothing, etc. in your prompt. Using image references of the character in different poses/scenes can also help. With enough tweaking and rerolling, you may get close to generating the same character.

Q: How do I make a logo with text using Midjourney?
It is difficult to get Midjourney to generate accurate text and logos. Midjourney does not have a strong understanding of typography or lettering. Some tips to try: 
 ‚Ä¢ Focus on one or two letters at a time, and combine them in an image editing tool. Midjourney may get short snippets of text (2-4 characters) correct, but struggles with longer phrases.
 ‚Ä¢ Use a text generator like Microsoft Designer to add stylized text on top of your Midjourney-generated base image.
 ‚Ä¢ Prompt for a "stylized letter" instead and build the logo letter by letter.
 ‚Ä¢ Avoid prompting for a completed "logo." This often does not turn out well. Prompt for the graphical elements you want, then do the text separately.
 ‚Ä¢ Consider using a different AI tool that specializes in graphics and logos, and is trained on a larger dataset of those samples. Midjourney is still limited in this area.
