# Troubleshooting Local Development Environment Setup

This page provides a solution to a common issue encountered during the setup of a local development environment. The issue was resolved by ensuring the presence of a `.env` file and installing the correct dependencies.

## Issue

The problem arose while setting up a local development environment. The build was failing, and the cause was initially unknown.

## Solution

The solution involved two steps:

1. **Adding a `.env` file:** The `.env` file contains personal access tokens for different services used in the project. The absence of this file was one of the causes of the issue.
2. **Installing `pnpm`:** The build was failing due to the absence of `pnpm`. Installing `pnpm` resolved this part of the issue.

After adding the `.env` file and installing `pnpm`, the local development environment was successfully set up.

```bash
# Example of installing pnpm
npm install -g pnpm
```

Please note that the `.env` file and `pnpm` might not be the only dependencies required for your project. Always refer to your project's documentation to ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
